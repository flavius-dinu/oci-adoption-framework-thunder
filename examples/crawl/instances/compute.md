# Compute Examples

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute offers significant price-performance and control improvements compared to on-premise data centers, while providing the elasticity and cost savings of the public cloud. Oracle has a longstanding reputation for providing technologies that empower enterprises to solve demanding business problemsâ€”and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the first cloud that's purpose-built to enable enterprises to run business-critical production workloads.

## Objectives
- Get familiar with the example
- Understand Thunder Compute Module Components
- Create instance using Thunder Compute

## Step 1 - Example & Module Details
This example is located in `thunder->examples->crawl->instances`.

The Compute module is able to create linux and windows instances with block volumes attached

## Step 2 - Prepare the dependencies
Apart from the **provider.auto.tfvars**, there may be some other dependencies in the **terraform.tfvars** file that you will have to address.
All the dependencies from this section should have resources that already exist in OCI.

For this module, you are going to have dependencies to some external resources:
- compartments
- subnets
- nsgs

In order to address those, you will need to change the values of the variables accordingly in the **terraform.tfvars** file.

Below, you will see the dependencies and what variables need to be changed.

### Compartment Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **compartment\_ids**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the compartments that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
compartment_ids = {
  sandbox = "ocid1.compartment.oc1.."
}
```

### Subnet Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **subnet\_ids**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the subnets that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
subnet_ids = {
  hur1pub  = "ocid1.subnet.oc1.."
  hur1priv = "ocid1.subnet.oc1.."
}
```

### NSG Dependency
In order to be able to run the sample code, you will have to prepare a map variable (like in the **terraform.tfvars** file) called **nsgs**, which will hold key/value pairs with the names and ids of the nsgs that you want to use.
This variable will be external in order to offer multiple ways of linking them from a terraform perspective.

```
nsgs = {
  "hurricane1" = "ocid1.networksecuritygroup.oc1.."
  "hurricane2" = "ocid1.networksecuritygroup.oc1.."
}
```

## Step 3 - What are you going to get
The definition of each resource can be inspected in the **terraform.tfvars** file in the `thunder->examples->crawl->instances` directory.

Don't forget to populate the **provider.auto.tfvars** with the details of your tenancy as specified in the [Lab 3 - Prerequisites Step 5](../../../workshop/index.html?lab=lab-3-install-prepare-prerequisites).

In the provided example, the following resources are created:

- 2 Linux Instances
    - One has 6 block volumes attached
    - The other one has 1 block volume attached

- 2 Windows Instances
    - One with 3 block volumes attached
    - The other one with 2 block volumes attached

In the example from below, there is a list of compartments containing 1 elements and a list of subnets containing 2 elements. By setting in compute\_params `compartment_name` to sandbox, the instances will be created in the sandbox compartmanet `ocid1.compartment.oc1..`. The same thing is happening to the subnet_ids and nsgs. All lists can be extended in order to satisfy your needs.

Below there is a snippet based on terraform.tfvars values:

This is just an example, but the number of the resources can be increased/decreased to suit any needs by adding another map in the specific resource type.

Don't forget to populate the provider with the details of your tenancy as specified in the main README.md file.

## Step 4 - Populate the images variable
Depending on your region, or what type of operating system you want to use inside of the example, you will have to populate the images variables from the **terraform.tfvars** file.

There are two images variables, one for linux and one for windows.
You will have to provide an ocid to the image based on the operating system.

Let's suppose you want to use a centos7 linux image in the us_ashburn region.
You can search for the images [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/images/).

Alternatively, there is a utility in `thunder->examples->crawl->compute_image_lister`
In order to use that for getting image ocids you will simply have to add a value to operating_system between the quotes and run `terraform apply` in that folder.

In the below example, I've added CentOS to the operating_system.
```
........................................
data "oci_core_images" "existing" {
  compartment_id           = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaaiu3vfcpbjwwgpil3xakqts4jhtjq42kktmisriiszdvvouwsirgq"
  operating_system         = "CentOS"  # -> HERE
  operating_system_version = ""
}
........................................
........................................
# Supported values:
# Operating System: 'Canonical Ubuntu', 'Oracle Linux', 'CentOS', 'Windows'
```

So now let's suppose you already got a centos7 ocid that looks like this `ocid1..etcetc`. You will have to add that under linux_images -> us_ashburn-1.
Below there is an example on how you can do it.

```
linux_images = {
  ap-melbourne-1  = {
    centos6 = "ocid1...."
    centos7 = "ocid1...."
    oel6    = "ocid1...."
    oel7    = "ocid1...."
  }
  ........................
  ........................
  us-ashburn-1    = {
    centos6 = "ocid1...."
    centos7 = "ocid1..etcetc" # -> HERE
    oel6    = "ocid1...."
    oel7    = "ocid1...."
  }
  us-langley-1    = {
    centos6 = "ocid1...."
    centos7 = "ocid1...."
    oel6    = "ocid1...."
    oel7    = "ocid1...."
  }
  us-luke-1       = {
    centos6 = "ocid1...."
    centos7 = "ocid1...."
    oel6    = "ocid1...."
    oel7    = "ocid1...."
  }
  us-phoenix-1    = {
    centos6 = "ocid1...."
    centos7 = "ocid1...."
    oel6    = "ocid1...."
    oel7    = "ocid1...."
  }
}
```

The exact same thing can be done for the Windows instances.
You will need to modify the `windows_images` variable.

## Step 5 - Running the code

Go to **thunder/examples/crawl/compute**
```
# Run init to get terraform modules
$ terraform init

# Create the infrastructure
$ terraform apply --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars

# If you are done with this infrastructure, take it down
$ terraform destroy --var-file=path_to_provider.auto.tfvars
```

## Results
After you've gone through this lab series, you now know:
- how the compute module works
- how you can get image ocids and add them to the terraform.tfvars file
- how you can easily create how many instances you want based on them
